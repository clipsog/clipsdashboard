# Comment Likes Guide

## How Comment Likes Work

Comment likes boost a **specific comment** on your TikTok video by adding likes to it. This makes that comment appear more popular and increases engagement.

## Service Details

- **Service ID**: 14718
- **Service Name**: "TikTok Comments Likes | By Username"
- **Minimum Order**: 50 likes
- **Rate**: $0.21 per 1,000 likes
- **When Ordered**: At 2,600 views milestone

## How It Works

### 1. Milestone Trigger

When views reach **2,600**, the bot will:
1. **Pause execution**
2. **Prompt you for a username**
3. **Order comment likes** for that username's comment
4. **Continue** with the delivery plan

### 2. Username Requirement

The service requires a **username** to identify which comment to like. This is the TikTok username of the person whose comment you want to boost.

**Example:**
- If someone commented as `@john_doe`, you would enter: `john_doe`
- If someone commented as `@the.clips.origins`, you would enter: `the.clips.origins`

### 3. The Prompt

When the milestone is reached, you'll see:

```
============================================================
🎯 MILESTONE REACHED: 2600 views
============================================================

It's time to order comment likes!
Video: https://www.tiktok.com/@the.clips.origins/video/...

The service requires a username to identify which comment to like.
This should be the username of the commenter whose comment you want to boost.

Enter the username (without @):
Or press Enter to skip (will try without username)

Username: [You type here]
```

### 4. Which Comment Should You Boost?

**Best Strategy:**
- **Your own comment** - If you commented on your video, boost that one
- **Top comment** - Boost the comment that's already getting engagement
- **Engaging comment** - Boost a comment that asks a question or encourages discussion

**To find the username:**
1. Go to your TikTok video
2. Scroll through the comments
3. Find the comment you want to boost
4. Note the username (without the @ symbol)

### 5. What Happens

1. **Bot orders 50 likes** (minimum) on the specified comment
2. **Likes are delivered gradually** over time
3. **Comment appears more popular** and gets more visibility
4. **Engagement increases** on your video

## Important Notes

### Minimum Order
- **Minimum**: 50 likes (even if you only want 15)
- The bot will order the minimum (50) to meet service requirements
- Cost: $0.0105 for 50 likes

### Username Format
- **Enter without @**: `john_doe` (not `@john_doe`)
- **Case sensitive**: Usernames are usually lowercase
- **Exact match**: Must match the exact username from TikTok

### If You Don't Know the Username
- You can **skip** (press Enter) and the bot will try without username
- However, the service may **require** a username
- **Best practice**: Check your video comments before the milestone

### Multiple Comments
- The service likes **one comment** per order
- If you want to boost multiple comments, you'd need multiple orders
- Current plan: One order of 50 likes on one comment

## Troubleshooting

### "Incorrect request" Error
- The service likely **requires** a username
- Make sure you enter the exact username (case-sensitive)
- Check that the username exists and has commented on your video

### Can't Find Username
1. Go to your TikTok video
2. Look at the comments section
3. Find the comment you want to boost
4. Copy the username exactly as shown (without @)

### Want to Boost Your Own Comment
- If you commented on your own video, use your TikTok username
- This is a common strategy to boost engagement

## Strategy Tips

1. **Comment First**: Post a comment on your video before starting the bot
2. **Engaging Comment**: Make it a question or call-to-action
3. **Boost It**: When milestone hits, enter your username to boost that comment
4. **Result**: Your comment gets 50+ likes, making it more visible
